restful-model
=============

A model generator that brings ActiveModel like functionality to javascript, but Restful by default.

Status
------

We've solidified the generate API. We consider this stable now. You can see it's uses on [the wiki page](https://github.com/thedeepwoodsbrigade/restful-model/wiki/Generating-a-Model)

Other wiki pages are now being added to explain how to create instance, get an collection of models from the server, etc. They'll be more updated this evening (2013-03-07).
